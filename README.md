Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website using a template from HTMl5up.net. The template is free for personal and commercial use but I will not claim 
any of the coding done in the template. The only changes I made was add my pictures, increase the size of the avatar, deleted some non-essentials, 
added the linkedin icon, set the links for the icons and made it so it would open into a new tab. If you need templates for a website I highly recommend HTML5up.net. 
They have great templates for websites that are all done through html5.
